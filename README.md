# 2025SOT-CE-PBPK

I will give a presentation entitled "Sensitivity, Uncertainty, and Variability Analyses of Physiologically Based Kinetic Models" in the upcoming 2025 SOT Meeting. This presentation is part of a Continued Education session entitled "Physiologically Based Kinetic Modeling Made Simple: A Nonprogrammerâ€™s Guide to Chemical Risk Assessment". In my presentation, I will present a few examples/exercises on how to perform sensitivity, uncertainty, and variability analyses of PBPK models. This repository contains relevant files to reproduce these examples and practice these exercises.
